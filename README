You'll need Racket to run this code.

Romeo is implemented in Redex (included in Racket). The actual execution of Romeo programs is in aa-redex-exec.rkt, where there are also some tests that should make things at least somewhat clear. Languages are defined in aa-redex-core.rkt, which might be a good place to start (it documents some of the notational differences with the paper). 

To run all the tests, do `raco test aa-redex-*`.
