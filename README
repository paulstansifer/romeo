Romeo:
  You'll need Racket to run this code.

  Romeo is implemented in Redex. The actual execution of Romeo programs is in aa-redex-exec.rkt, where there are also some tests that should make things at least somewhat clear. Languages are defined in aa-redex-core.rkt. All implementation is in files beginning with `aa-redex-`. The paper is contained in `icfp2014/`.


Romeo-L:
  I haven't checked to see if the Romeo-to-Romeo-L link hasn't bitrotted.

  Romeo-L has a hashlang associated with it. To enable hashlangs, use `raco link <name of directory>` and then `#lang <name of directory>'
